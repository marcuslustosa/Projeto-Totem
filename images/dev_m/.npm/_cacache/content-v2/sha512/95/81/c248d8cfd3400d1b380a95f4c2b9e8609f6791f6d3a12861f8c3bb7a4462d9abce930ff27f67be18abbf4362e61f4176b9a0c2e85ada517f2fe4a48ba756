They accept `ScrollView`, `SectionList` and `FlatList` default props respectively and\nimplement a custom high order component called `KeyboardAwareHOC` to handle keyboard appearance.\nThe high order component is also available if you want to use it in any other component.\n\nImport `react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view` and wrap your content inside\nit:\n\n```js\nimport { KeyboardAwareScrollView } from 'react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view'\n```\n\n```jsx\n<KeyboardAwareScrollView>\n  <View>\n    <TextInput />\n  </View>\n</KeyboardAwareScrollView>\n```\n\n## Auto-scroll in `TextInput` fields\n\nAs of `v0.1.0`, the component auto scrolls to the focused `TextInput` 😎. For versions `v0.0.7` and older you can do the following.\n\n### Programatically scroll to any `TextInput`\n\nIn order to scroll to any `TextInput` field, you can use the built-in method `scrollToFocusedInput`. Example:\n\n```js\n_scrollToInput (reactNode: any) {\n  // Add a 'scroll' ref to your ScrollView\n  this.scroll.props.scrollToFocusedInput(reactNode)\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n<KeyboardAwareScrollView\n  innerRef={ref => {\n    this.scroll = ref\n  }}>\n  <View>\n    <TextInput\n      onFocus={(event: Event) => {\n        // `bind` the function if you're using ES6 classes\n        this._scrollToInput(ReactNative.findNodeHandle(event.target))\n      }}\n    />\n  </View>\n</KeyboardAwareScrollView>\n```\n\n### Programatically scroll to any position\n\nThere's another built-in function that lets you programatically scroll to any position of the scroll view:\n\n```js\nthis.scroll.props.scrollToPosition(0, 0)\n```\n\n## Register to keyboard events\n\nYou can register to `ScrollViewResponder` events `onKeyboardWillShow` and `onKeyboardWillHide`:\n\n```jsx\n<KeyboardAwareScrollView\n  onKeyboardWillShow={(frames: Object) => {\n    console.log('Keyboard event', frames)\n  }}>\n  <View>\n    <TextInput />\n  </View>\n</KeyboardAwareScrollView>\n```\n\n## Android Support\n\nFirst, Android natively has this feature, you can easily enable it by setting `windowSoftInputMode` in `AndroidManifest.xml`. Check [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#wsoft).\n\nBut if you want to use feature like `extraHeight`, you need to enable Android Support with the following steps:\n\n- Make sure you are using react-native `0.46` or above.\n- Set `windowSoftInputMode` to `adjustPan` in `AndroidManifest.xml`.\n- Set `enableOnAndroid` property to `true`.\n\nAndroid Support is not perfect, here is the supported list:\n\n| **Prop**                    | **Android Support** |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| `viewIsInsideTabBar`        | Yes                 |\n| `resetScrollToCoords`       | Yes                 |\n| `enableAutomaticScroll`     | Yes                 |\n| `extraHeight`               | Yes                 |\n| `extraScrollHeight`         | Yes                 |\n| `enableResetScrollToCoords` | Yes                 |\n| `keyboardOpeningTime`       | No                  |\n\n## API\n\n### Props\n\nAll the `ScrollView`/`FlatList` props will be passed.\n\n| **Prop**                    | **Type**                         | **Description**                                                                                |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `innerRef`                  | `Function`                       | Catch the reference of the component.                                                          |\n| `viewIsInsideTabBar`        | `boolean`                        | Adds an extra offset that represents the `TabBarIOS` height.                                   |\n| `resetScrollToCoords`       | `Object: {x: number, y: number}` | Coordinates that will be used to reset the scroll when the keyboard hides.                     |\n| `enableAutomaticScroll`     | `boolean`                        | When focus in `TextInput` will scroll the position, default is enabled.                        |\n| `extraHeight`               | `number`                         | Adds an extra offset when focusing the `TextInput`s.                                           |\n| `extraScrollHeight`         | `number`                         | Adds an extra offset to the keyboard.

Take a look at the code of `KeyboardAwareFlatList`:\n\n```js\n/* @flow */\n\nimport { FlatList } from 'react-native'\nimport listenToKeyboardEvents from './KeyboardAwareHOC'\n\nexport default listenToKeyboardEvents(FlatList)\n```\n\nThe HOC can also be configured. Sometimes it's more convenient to provide a static config than configuring the behavior with props. This HOC config can be overriden with props.\n\n```js\n/* @flow */\n\nimport { FlatList } from 'react-native'\nimport listenToKeyboardEvents from './KeyboardAwareHOC'\n\nconst config = {\n  enableOnAndroid: true,\n  enableAutomaticScroll: true\n}\n\nexport default listenToKeyboardEvents(config)(FlatList)\n```\n\nThe available config options are:\n\n```js\n{\n  enableOnAndroid: boolean,\n  contentContainerStyle: ?Object,\n  enableAutomaticScroll: boolean,\n  extraHeight: number,\n  extraScrollHeight: number,\n  enableResetScrollToCoords: boolean,\n  keyboardOpeningTime: number,\n  viewIsInsideTabBar: boolean,\n  refPropName: string,\n  extractNativeRef: Function\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT.\n\n## Author\n\nÁlvaro Medina Ballester `<amedina at apsl.net>`\n\nBuilt with 💛 by [APSL](https://github.com/apsl).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"slorber","email":"lorber.sebastien@gmail.com"},{"name":"alvaromb","email":"me@alvaromb.com"},{"name":"apsl","email":"developers@apsl.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-26T06:30:10.049Z","created":"2015-11-05T08:51:01.518Z","0.0.1":"2015-11-05T08:51:01.518Z","0.0.2":"2015-11-09T10:52:37.048Z","0.0.3":"2015-11-09T14:21:24.606Z","0.0.4":"2016-01-11T08:16:15.991Z","0.0.5":"2016-03-21T08:02:07.472Z","0.0.6":"2016-03-23T07:37:34.326Z","0.0.7":"2016-05-11T09:49:26.372Z","0.1.0":"2016-05-31T13:54:09.322Z","0.1.1":"2016-06-13T10:50:36.703Z","0.1.2":"2016-06-17T07:19:43.446Z","0.2.0":"2016-08-23T08:08:15.829Z","0.2.1":"2016-10-06T09:04:42.652Z","0.2.2":"2016-11-07T14:33:11.205Z","0.2.3":"2016-11-11T11:30:16.709Z","0.2.4":"2016-11-16T10:28:28.654Z","0.2.5":"2016-12-19T10:09:51.393Z","0.2.6":"2016-12-29T08:39:26.908Z","0.2.7":"2017-02-03T11:35:35.051Z","0.2.8":"2017-03-27T08:02:54.918Z","0.2.9":"2017-05-18T08:09:08.338Z","0.3.0":"2017-08-09T09:50:54.011Z","0.4.0":"2017-10-24T10:18:53.383Z","0.4.1":"2017-10-24T12:20:43.643Z","0.4.2":"2018-01-15T08:54:35.281Z","0.4.3":"2018-01-19T17:20:16.798Z","0.4.4":"2018-02-19T10:29:57.560Z","0.5.0":"2018-03-19T11:50:06.582Z","0.6.0":"2018-06-22T16:26:08.903Z","0.7.0":"2018-08-12T10:12:24.283Z","0.7.1":"2018-08-22T15:54:51.358Z","0.7.2":"2018-08-27T06:49:12.344Z","0.7.3":"2018-10-11T09:16:19.016Z","0.7.4":"2018-10-18T05:41:33.121Z","0.8.0":"2018-12-10T08:20:00.569Z","0.9.0":"2019-08-14T20:29:38.843Z","0.9.1":"2019-08-14T20:46:52.355Z","0.9.2":"2020-07-30T14:53:42.681Z","0.9.3":"2020-10-06T13:37:39.846Z","0.9.4":"2021-04-29T16:32:18.157Z","0.9.5":"2021-11-04T10:02:02.898Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view#readme","keywords":["react","react-native","scrollview","keyboard","ios","android","react-component"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view.git"},"author":{"name":"Alvaro Medina Ballester","email":"me@alvaromb.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"locsian":true,"leandrodavimg":true,"swimly":true,"jacob-beltran":true,"liorgrosman":true,"sopov":true}}
